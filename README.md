# Kelpie_Mainboard(2023-2024)
 This is the Mainboard I designed for the kelpie robotics 2023-2024 season. It contains many sensors required to complete various tasks at the competition. It also houses an orange Pi, and a pi pico for communication across components. It is powered by a motherboard like PCB, which the mainboard is designed to slot into.
