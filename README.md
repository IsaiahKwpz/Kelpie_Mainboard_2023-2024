# Kelpie_Mainboard(2023-2024)
 This is the Mainboard I designed for the kelpie robotics 2023-2024 season. It contains many sensors required to complete various tasks at the competition. It also houses an orange Pi, and a pi pico for communication across componenets. It is powered from a motherboard like PCB, which it is designed to slot into.
